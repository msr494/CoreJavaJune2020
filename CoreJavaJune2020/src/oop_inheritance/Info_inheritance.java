Single Inheritance: When a Derived Class to inherit properties and behavior from a single parent class/base class/superclass, it is called as single inheritance.
Multi-Level Inheritance: A derived class is created from another derived class is called Multi Level Inheritance.
Hierarchical Inheritance: More than one derived class are created from a single base class is called Hierarchical Inheritance.
Multiple Inheritance: Classes that combine aspects of multiple classes and their corresponding hierarchies. example: I am inherited from dad class and mom class.
