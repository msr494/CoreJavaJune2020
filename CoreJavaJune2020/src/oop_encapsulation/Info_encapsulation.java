Write down the OOP features.
-- Abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation and Polymorphism are the features of java OOP.
What is Encapsulation?
-- Encapsulation means data hiding. By doing encapsulation, data only can be accessed by public methods. 
-- There are various way to hide the data. By making a method, variable private access limits to the class user.
-- By using getter and setter method private data can be accessed
-- Hiding, implementation of methods and data from user is called encapsulation.
-- It improves maintainability and flexibility and re-usability. The fields can be made read-only. User would not be knowing what is going on behind the scene. They would only be knowing that to update a field call set method and to read a field call get method but what these set and get methods are doing is purely hidden from them.
