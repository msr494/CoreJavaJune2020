What is Polymorphism? 
-- Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. 
What are the different types of Polymorphism and when that happen?
-- Static Polymorphism or early binding (method overloading): happens in compile time. 
-- Dynamic Polymorphism or late binding (method overriding): happens in Run time.
What is method overloading and when it happens?
-- When different methods exist with the same method name but with different parameters or signature, is called method overloading. Method Overloading occurs during compile time.
What is static binding and dynamic binding?
-- Static binding in Java occurs during compile time while dynamic binding occurs during runtime. Overloaded methods are bonded using static binding at compile time while overridden methods are bonded using dynamic binding at runtime.
